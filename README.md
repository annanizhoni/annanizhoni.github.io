My first website build. Created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. It is mostly responsive other than some of the coding projects. I am in the process of adding to this project and fine tuning it. 


## Features

- Responsive on mobile devices
- Embedded YouTube video introducing myself


## Roadmap

- Utilize a dropdown toggle menu for mobile devices using bootstrap. I attempted this, but could not get it to work. 

- Get the Bootstrap contact form to function properly. I attempted to use MAMP and PHP to add functionality, but was unsuccessful. 

- Add more coding and UX design projects.
